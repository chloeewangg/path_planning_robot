A path-planning robot which can explore, build maps, find goals, and find prizes on simple maps. The robot features a collect of robust behaviors, including line-following and blockage-detection. This project was developed as part of the Experimental Robotics course at Caltech, aiming to turn simple mechanical devices equipped with simple sensors into robust, autonomous robots.
